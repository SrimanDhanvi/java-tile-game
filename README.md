# java-tile-game
This project is a 2D tile-based Java simulation designed to showcase my proficiency in Java programming and object-oriented design. It demonstrates key skills including:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.

2. Algorithm Design: Procedural generation of environments, movement coordination, and game logic.

3. Event Handling & Input Management: Handling user input and interactive controls.

4. Graphics & Rendering: Drawing and updating game elements using Javaâ€™s graphics libraries.

5. Data Structures: Use of arrays, lists, and maps to manage game state efficiently.
